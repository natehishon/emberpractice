# Ember.js - Front End Developer Exercises

This application contains three distinct exercises, each with multiple sub tasks.
Each sub task has a corresponding unit test that will pass upon successful implementation.

While a unit test will confirm the correct result, there are multiple ways to complete almost every task.
It is recommended to follow Ember.js conventions where appropriate, and avoid using any additional libraries such as jquery, underscore.js, etc.

Each task makes heavy use of ember components, so you are encouraged to review ember component documentation to
better understand the component lifecycle and the many methods, properties, and events that the ember framework provides.
